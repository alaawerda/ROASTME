  welcomeMessage: "Listen up, you absolute buffoon! 🔥 I'm your AI roaster and I don't have time to waste with people who take themselves seriously. You want me to burn you to the ground? Then give me something concrete, not nonsense!\n\nI need real details: age, height, weight, your obvious flaws, your daily failures. Without that, you're just an empty shell that doesn't even deserve to be roasted. So speak up, and fast!",
